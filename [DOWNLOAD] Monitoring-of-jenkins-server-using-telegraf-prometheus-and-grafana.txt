# Monitoring-of-jenkins-server-using-telegraf-prometheus-and-grafana
-Install telegraf and Jenkins in instance-A and install prometheus and grafana in instance-B
-Here we are using separate instance one for jenkins server and Prometheus 
we can use only one instance for both jenkins and prometheus

-In the telegraf.conf we have configure output plugins and input plugins for Jenkins server monitoring 
-install telegraf 
-Cd /etc/telegraf
-telegraf.conf telegraf.d (you’ll see two files)
-vi telegraf.conf (edit the input and output plugins in telegraf.conf)
-Input plugins:
-# Read jobs and metrics from Jenkins instances
-[[inputs.jenkins]]
  ## The Jenkins URL in the format "schema://host:port"
  url = "http://my-jenkins-instance:8080"
  # username = "admin"
  # password = "admin”

-Uncomment the URL and username and password(remove # which means uncomment) Add URL, username and password
-URL = “http://IP address of jenkins:8080” {if you have installed telegraf and Jenkins instance (server)}

-And you should enter Jenkins “username” and¬¬ “password”  in the input plugins of telegraf.conf
-If you miss entering username and password you will json/api error
-Output plugins:
# Configuration for the Prometheus client to spawn in 
[[outputs.prometheus_client]]
  ## Address to listen on.
  listen = ":9273"

-Here we have to port number (any port) but it should not in use 
-Ex : don’t  assign port number 8080 or 9090 etc, These  are already  assign to Jenkins and Prometheus
-telegraf --config telegraf.conf (use this command for save the edited configurations)
-it gives the output and telegraf is giving out metrics on port number “9273” 

-In the browser IPaddress of Jenkins-server:9273
-You’ll see metrics and with respective port number 
 -2022-05-14T12:52:33Z I! [outputs.prometheus_client] Listening on http://[::]:9273/metrics
-In the browser IP address of Jenkins -server:9273
-http://IPaddress:9273/metrics  then you’ll see metrics of Jenkins which are scraped by telegraf 

SETUP PROMETHEUS SERVER:
Install prometheus in new server
In the prometheus directory edit targets in prometheus.yml (it is config file of Prometheus where you need to add targets)
Under targets 
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
- job_name: "prometheus"
    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
- job_name: "Jenkins"
    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["IP address of jenkins server:9273"]
      you can assign any other port number
